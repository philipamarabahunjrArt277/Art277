  <h2 style="text-align:center">Mission</h2>

Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food insecurity, using technology to 

empower community organizations and local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in 
need.
<h2 style="text-align:center;">How we help</h2>
<p>Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our volunteers and delivery partners so 
groceries, medication and essential supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes 
community volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive 
solution for partners to scale their own impact.
<img style="float: left; margin-right:16px;" src="man.jpg"  height="200px" width="150px" ><br><br>Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch 
requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we connect 
individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.<br /><br>
Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second 
Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer 
shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale. We've 
grown the number of people we can help by working together—and we 
are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our mission.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Join our team</h2>
<p>
Founded by veterans of Uber, Facebook, and Google, as well as students beginning their careers, the 
Lemme Help organization comprises more than 150 volunteers around the country who want to give 
back. Together, we make local volunteerism easy and reliable for our partners and help to slow the 
national spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about making a difference in people’s lives, we’d love to have you join our team of dedicated volunteers!</p>
